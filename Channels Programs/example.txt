The Omega Team was the soul of the company. Whereas the rest of the
enterprise brought in the money to keep things going, by various commercial
applications of narrow AI, the Omega Team pushed ahead in their quest for what
had always been the CEO’s dream: building general artificial intelligence. Most
other employees viewed “the Omegas,” as they affectionately called them, as a
bunch of pie-in-the-sky dreamers, perpetually decades away from their goal.
They happily indulged them, however, because they liked the prestige that the
cutting-edge work of the Omegas gave their company, and they also appreciated
the improved algorithms that the Omegas occasionally gave them.
