The stack is the simplest of all structures.with an obvious interpretation.putting
objects on the stack and taking them off again.with access possible only to the
top item.For this reason they are sometimes also described as LIFO storage.last in.first out.Stacks occur in programming wherever we have nested blocks.local variables.recursive definitions.or backtracking.Typical programming exercises that involve a stack.are the evaluation of arithmetic expressions.with parentheses and operator priorities.or search in a labyrinth with backtracking.
