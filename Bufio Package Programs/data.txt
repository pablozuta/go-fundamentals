Thirteen point eight billion years after its birth, our Universe has awoken and
become aware of itself. From a small blue planet, tiny conscious parts of our
Universe have begun gazing out into the cosmos with telescopes, repeatedly
discovering that everything they thought existed is merely a small part of
something grander: a solar system, a galaxy and a universe with over a hundred
billion other galaxies arranged into an elaborate pattern of groups, clusters and
superclusters. Although these self-aware stargazers disagree on many things,
they tend to agree that these galaxies are beautiful and awe-inspiring.
